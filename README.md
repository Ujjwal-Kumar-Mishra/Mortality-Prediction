# Mortality-Prediction
In this project, I do an experience study on the mortality from 1991-2018. Leveraging the
machine learning algorithms of linear regression, gradient boosting regression and support vector
regression, I forecast the one-year death rates in the year 2018 by using the mortality experienced from
1991-2017.
